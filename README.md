Description:

Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies have gained attention over
the years as the systems continue to evolve.  This course looks at the
design of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how they function in
practice, focusing on cryptography, game theory, and network
architecture.  Future developments in smart contracts and privacy will
be covered as well.  Programming assignments in the course will give
practical experience interacting with these currencies, so some
programming experience is required.

Office hours: 4-6 PM Tuesdays

Office hours location:  The big table outside E15-357

TA: James Lovejoy [jlovejoy@mit.edu](jlovejoy@mit.edu)

## Final Projects

You may form groups of 1-4 students and prepare a
presentation and a 4 page paper on one of the following:

1.  Design and implement an application or system ([project ideas](projects.md))
2.  Add a new feature to an existing system like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another cryptocurrency or shared ledger implementation
3.  Propose a formalization in this space for a topic that has not been formalized yet  
4.  Pose and solve an interesting problem
